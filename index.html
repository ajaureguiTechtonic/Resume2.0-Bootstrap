          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>As I transition into my career as a Web Developer, my passion to help lead individuals to solutions is at the core of who I am. As an energetic adaptable problem solver, I strive to produce great results through collaboration with teams in which I can foster my skills development and growth to be a part of of building web applications that improve user experiences and produce results. I want to be challenged to bring solutions to fruition through the use of different technologies. I am a critical thinker with excellent communication skills, a strong work ethic and experience in leadership roles. I believe positivity and empathy are critical for success in a work environment, and while I thrive when I work collaboratively with others I am comfortable working independently as well.</p>
